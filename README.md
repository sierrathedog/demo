# Foldda Automation - Project Overview

Foldda Automation is a simple and practical component-based application framework. It allows highly efficient and easy-to-maintain component-based software development benefitted from a higher degree of code sharing and reuse. Foldda Automation includes a simple API that defines the logical, programming boundary of "open-market and reusable" components, and the component hosting and execution environment, called a runtime, that allows compliant components to work collaboratively together as an app.

Foldda Automation is designed for vendor-independent, "open" component development, which means, it allows independently developed software modules, or components, to connect and collaborate in an application. This repo contains more detailed instructions and examples to assist developers in creating new compliant components from scratch or making changes to the provided components. 

You can visit the project's main repo for a more detailed introduction and demos about the Foldda Automation framework in general.
