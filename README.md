# Foldda Automation Documentation

Foldda Automation is a simple and practical component-based application framework. It allows highly efficient and easy-to-maintain component-based software development which inherited benefits from the system's high degree of code sharing and reuse. 

Foldda Automation includes a simple API that defines the logical, programming boundary of "open-market and reusable" components, and the component hosting and execution environment, called a runtime, that allows compliant components to work collaboratively together as an app. The framework is purposely designed for vendor-independent, "open" component development, allowing independently developed software components to connect and collaborate in an application. To assist in this effort, this repo provides detailed instructions and usage examples to help developers better understand and create new compliant components from scratch or make changes to the existing components. 

You can visit the project's main repo for a general introduction and demos about the Foldda Automation framework.
