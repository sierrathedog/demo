# A Modular App-development Framework

Bloc allows modules developed independently by different vendors to work together in an app, so it's true vendor-independent software component framework.

It utilizes the simple and flexible "universal data container" called Recurrsive Delimited Array (RDA) for the connected modules to exchange data, so the loose coupling is achieved in the framework architecture.
